    "text": "We created A GENTE because we believe that good design begins with empathy: for the people, the stories, and the brands that deserve to be seen. We don't just create projects; we create meaning, together.",
    "aboutHe": "I’m Uildes. A minimalist raised by design, with almost 10 years of experience in visual design, four years in web development, and a mix of creative skills. From video editing and animation to web optimization. (The perfect combo for brands that want to impress and perform, don’t you think?) <br></br><br></br>I’m self-taught by nature, driven by ambition, focus, and a constant need to refine everything I do. Do I enjoy what I do? Absolutely. I can’t imagine a life where I’m not creating something meaningful. <br></br><br></br>And to balance my minimalist and simple side, I have my little pink dot ✦ (my wife). <br></br><br></br>Together, we blend creativity and strategy, the harmony that keeps A GENTE alive.",
    "aboutShe": "I’m Ayalla. The voice and the vision behind every detail that turns an idea into emotion. I’ve always been driven by what’s visual. Colors, shapes, and textures fascinate me, they’re how I express myself. <br></br><br></br>I believe aesthetics are more than appearance: they’re emotion, intention, and the spark that makes someone stop and feel something real. <br></br><br></br>I’m drawn to what’s light, but also to what holds depth.  To the contrast between the simple and the unforgettable. <br></br><br></br>And among all those tones and shades, there’s him: a huge point of happiness in my life (My husband). Together, we’re the balance between emotion and structure. The essence of what A Gente truly is."

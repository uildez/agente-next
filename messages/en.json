    "title": "Who we are?",
    "text": "We created A GENTE because we believe that good design begins with empathy: for the people, the stories, and the brands that deserve to be seen. We don't just create projects; we create meaning, together.",
    "aboutHe": "I’m Uildes. A minimalist raised by design, with almost 10 years of experience in visual design, four years in web development, and a mix of creative skills. From video editing and animation to web optimization. (The perfect combo for brands that want to impress and perform, don’t you think?) <br></br><br></br>I’m self-taught by nature, driven by ambition, focus, and a constant need to refine everything I do. Do I enjoy what I do? Absolutely. I can’t imagine a life where I’m not creating something meaningful. <br></br><br></br>And to balance my minimalist and simple side, I have my little pink dot ✦ (my wife). <br></br><br></br>Together, we blend creativity and strategy, the harmony that keeps A GENTE alive.",
    "aboutShe": "I’m Ayalla. The voice and the vision behind every detail that turns an idea into emotion. I’ve always been driven by what’s visual. Colors, shapes, and textures fascinate me, they’re how I express myself. <br></br><br></br>I believe aesthetics are more than appearance: they’re emotion, intention, and the spark that makes someone stop and feel something real. <br></br><br></br>I’m drawn to what’s light, but also to what holds depth.  To the contrast between the simple and the unforgettable. <br></br><br></br>And among all those tones and shades, there’s him: a huge point of happiness in my life (Uildes). He’s the one who grounds the beautiful chaos of my ideas and turns imagination into reality. Together, we’re the balance between emotion and structure. The essence of what A Gente truly is."
